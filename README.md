## Introduction
This project, undertaken as part of my Master's program in Data Science, involved an individual assignment to predict potential risk factors leading to cardiovascular (heart) failures. By employing exploratory data analysis and various machine learning algorithms, my objective was to develop a reliable prediction model capable of anticipating heart failures based on multiple risk factors.

### Research Question
Are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, XGBoost algorithms good models for predicting the possible heart disease based on clinical risk factors like chest pain type, cholesterol level, resting ECG, fasting blood sugar, maximum heart rate?

### Dataset Description
The dataset downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) includes one target variable and 11 input variables (5 categorical and 6 numerical), totaling 918 instances with no null-values.

## Technologies
This project was developed using Python 3.8.5 in a Jupyter Notebook environment. The following libraries and modules were utilized:
* **Pandas 1.4.1** - Data manipulation and analysis
* **Numpy 1.22.1** - Numerical computations
* **Seaborn 0.11.2** - Data visualization
* **Matplotlib 3.5.1** - Creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
* **Plotly 5.5.0** - Interactive visualizations
* **PrettyTable 3.3.0** - Table creation and formatting
* **Scikit-learn (Sklearn) 1.1.1** - Machine learning algorithms and tools

## Methods Used
The following methods and models were employed in this project:
* Standard Scaler
* Logistic Regression Classifier
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
* Decision Tree Classifier
* Random Forest Classifier
* Gradient Boosting Classifier
* Support Vector Machine Classifier (SVC)
* Grid search Cross validation
* Permutation Importance
